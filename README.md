# Road_safety_analysis

This project is a detailed analysis of how to predict the conditions during which maximum road accidents occurs. 
The project consists of two parts- Driver drowsiness prediction and road accidents. 
The first part uses image classification to detect driverâ€™s drowsiness using a dataset consisting of images. 
The second part predicts the severity of an accident based on certain conditions such as weather or light conditions.
